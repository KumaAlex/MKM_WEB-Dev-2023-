            Notepad++ is a source code editor. It features syntax highlighting, code folding and limited
            autocompletion for programming, scripting, and markup languages, but not intelligent code
            completion or syntax checking. As such, it may properly highlight code written in a
            supported schema, but whether the syntax is internally sound or compilable, cannot be verified.
            Notepad++ can highlight the elements of 78 syntaxes

        <p class="editor__description">
            Sublime Text is a shareware text and source code editor.
            It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages. Users can
            customize it with
            themes and expand its functionality with plugins, typically community-built and
            maintained under
            free-software licenses. To facilitate plugins, Sublime Text features a Python API. The
            editor
            utilizes minimal interface and contains features for programmers including configurable
            syntax
            highlighting, code folding, search-and-replace supporting regular-expressions, terminal
            output
            window, and more.

        <p class="editor__description">
            Atom was a "hackable" text editor, which means it was customizable using
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            Atom was a desktop application built using web technologies. It was
            based on the Electron framework,
            which was developed for that purpose, and hence was formerly called Atom
            Shell.
            Electron is a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications
            using Chromium and Node.js.
